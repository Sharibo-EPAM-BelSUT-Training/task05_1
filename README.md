# task05_1
First part of fifth task in **[EPAM BelSUT Training](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training)**.

I learned generics and sorting collections, in particular Johnson's algorithm. I created documentation comments and generated a [javadoc](https://sharibo-epam-belsut-training.github.io/task05_1/). In the end I built a [jar-file](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training/task05_1/releases).
